		<p>My name is Joe Bridenbaugh and I am Uncle Joe to a lot of people in the fight game. Some friends and I helped put together the first sanctioned by the State of Ohio amateur MMA fight in Ohio. I still help to do a lot of fight shows in the area and I wanted to use this site to help promote these fighters and show some of the videos I have collected over the years.</p>
